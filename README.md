# Sign-Language-Detecttion

Real Time Sign Language Detection Project using WebCam.
Currently working on this project and after completed then move it to mobile devices.

Download link for dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet/kernels

Here I using the pre-trained model i.e Mobilenet_v2

Due to Hardware restriction I train Model on Kaggle playgroud.
Validation Accuracy = 0.9947917 and Validation Loss = 0.03621217922773212

Now, the Project is on the Real-Time i.e When you capture the image from the web then the model takes that image and predict the Alphabet.
See the code "Real-time.py" for using the model in Real-time Basis.
